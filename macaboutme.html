<p>My name is Mac and I make wire wrapped jewlry,tincitures,organic
herbal teas and much much more.I am self-taught but i had a freind who inspired me to start this journey. I was looking for a hobby but it has turned into a career. I will also make custome jewlry for a higher price upon request. I can change stones or wire wrapping styles of any item within reason, or send a picture of something. </p>

<p>I met somone that made jewlry to sell and wanted to try it myself.we started making jewlry togeather and selling them on ebay. I also started selling at a local yard sale here in Georgia. I made a halloween coustme completly from scratch and also made jewlry to go with that. It turned out so well that i won a halloween custome contest, and it has grown from there.</p>
<p> I am a reiki master and through that I learned to make perfumes, aromatheripy oils,ticncitures and health and beauty products. Everything i make in natural and genuine crystals.</p>
